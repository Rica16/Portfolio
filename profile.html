                <h3>My Profile</h3>
                <p>Rezza Mae Capilitan, a 19-year-old currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information
                    Technology at the University of Antique, hails from the vibrant town of Leon, Iloilo. With 
                    a passion for technology and a drive to explore my ever-evolving landscape, I'm on a journey 
                    to harness the power of Information Technology. Beyond academic pursuits, I brings a unique 
                    perspective shaped by the rich cultural tapestry of my hometown, infusing creativity and innovation
                    into my approach towards IT. As I navigates my academic path, I remains dedicated to expanding
                    my knowledge, honing my skills, and contributing meaningfully to the world of technology.
                </p>

                <p>I've consistently embodied the essence of an achiever, showcasing remarkable dedication and excellence
                    throughout my academic journey from elementary to junior high school. My unwavering commitment to academic
                    success, coupled with a relentless pursuit of personal growth, has been a defining trait. Embracing
                    challenges with determination, I've continually surpassed expectations, setting high standards for myself
                    and inspiring those around me. My motto in life reflects this resilience: "In every twist and turn, life must
                    go on". This powerful mantra encapsulates my belief in persevering through life's adversities, embracing change, 
                    and persistently moving forward, no matter the circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>I'm someone with a vast array of dreams and aspirations, brimming with ambitions and goals for the future.
                    However, there are moments when the allure of immediate gratification tempts me away from my studies, sparking
                    thoughts about transitioning into the workforce. The concept of life's brevity often guides my perspective,
                    urging me to seize every moment and live life to its utmost potential. As a young individual, the idea of 
                    relishing the teenage years, enjoying the vibrant experiences they offer, is crucial to me. While I've previously
                    achieved remarkable feats academically, me now seek a simpler, quieter existence as a good student, yearning for 
                    peace of mind amid the hustle and bustle of life's demands. This phase represents a transition - a balance, and 
                    finding contentment in the moment.
